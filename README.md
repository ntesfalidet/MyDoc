# MyDoc

## Motive
Inspired by hackathon projects (at HackIllinois 2017) that enforces software application in the medical industry, I was excited to work on a project that involves a patient going through a medical evaluation before visiting a physician. Most medical software and technologies are designed for interactions between healthcare providers, but how cool would it be to have an application designed for interactions between physicians and patients. The application model for MyDoc is quite simple, the user/patient can state or list medical symptoms, through voice input of the echo dot, that can be used as a medical evaluation by the physicians. The idea is to find a way to get the patient to the physician much faster by having an intermediary doctor to speed up parts or take up simple instructions of a medical evaluation, MyDoc.
